# WIP - Complete react-redux example project
An example project based on the folder structure proposed here: https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks

## Usage

**Clone the repo**
```
git clone git@github.com:FortechRomania/react-redux-complete-example.git
```

**Install dependencies**
```
npm i
```
or with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), which I highly recommend
```
yarn
```

**Run project**
```
npm run compile-js
npm run dev-server
```
or both tasks in parallel in a single terminal
```
npm start
```

Access `localhost:7777` to see the magic.

## Todos
- [x] Ducks modular approach
- [ ] Server render with RR 4
- [ ] Redux Dev Tools / HMR
- [ ] Style compilation with webpack
