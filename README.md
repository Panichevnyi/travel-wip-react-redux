## Usage

**Install dependencies**
```
npm i
```
or with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), which I highly recommend
```
yarn
```

**Run project**
```
npm run compile
npm run dev-server
```
or both tasks in parallel in a single terminal
```
npm start
```

Access `localhost:7777` to see the magic.

Running the tests
```
npm run test
```

Running eslint
```
npm run linter
```
